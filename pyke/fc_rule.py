    Forward chaining rules (fc_rule) are one of two types of rules in a
    rule_base (the other being backward chaining rules -- bc_rule).

    All forward chaining is done automatically as each rule_base is
    activated.  This is done in two steps:

        1.  All fc_rules are registered with the fact_lists referenced in
            their 'foreach' clause by calling fc_rule.register_rule() on
            each fc_rule (including the parent rule_base's fc_rules).

            This will cause the fact_list to invoke fc_rule.new_fact each time
            a new fact for that fact_list (by that name) is asserted (by the
            same or another fc_rule).

        2.  The fc_rule.run() function is called on each fc_rule (including
            the parent rule_base's fc_rules).

    The forward chaining rule is compiled into a python function which does
    the actual inferencing work for both the 'run' case and the 'new_fact'
    case, depending on the arguments passed to it.  Each fc_rule object
    remembers its associated compiled python function.

    The fc_rule object tracks the progress of the forward chaining for that
    rule.  If the rule has not been run yet, it ignores new_facts since it
    will see the new fact when it is later run.
