# Since all other relationships depend on child_parent and sibling
# relationships, we're just going to go ahead and assert all child_parent and
# sibling relationships with forward-chaining rules.  If we use
# backward-chaining rules for these, we would have to re-run the rules each
# time the facts are needed for the same people.  This avoids that.
