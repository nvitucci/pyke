=============================================
Fc_rule Syntax
=============================================

Fc_rule
=============

Forward-chaining_ rules have three parts:

#. A unique name.
#. An optional `foreach clause`_.
#. An `assert clause`_.

::

    fc_rule ::= IDENTIFIER NL INDENT
                   [fc_foreach]
                   fc_assert
                DEINDENT

The ``IDENTIFIER`` uniquely names this rule_ and is used as the corresponding
Python function name in the generated <rb_name>_fc.py file.

Foreach clause
=================

::

    fc_foreach ::= 'foreach' NL INDENT
                       {fc_premise NL}
                   DEINDENT

    fc_premise ::= fact_pattern
                 | compound_premise
                 | python_premise

    fact_pattern ::= IDENTIFIER '.' IDENTIFIER '(' [{pattern,}] ')'

Here are links to the definitions for pattern_, compound_premise_ and
python_premise_.

If the ``foreach`` clause is omitted, the rule_ is always fired once.

If the ``foreach`` clause is present, the rule is fired for each combination
of true premises.

Assert clause
=================

::

    fc_assert ::= 'assert' NL INDENT
                      {assertion NL}
                  DEINDENT

    assertion ::= fact_pattern
                | python_statements

Here is the link to the definitions of python_statements_.

The ``assert`` clause lists new facts_ to assert, and/or Python
statements to execute each time the rule_ is fired.  Each of these may
include `pattern variables`_ which should also appear in the ``foreach``
clause where they are bound to a value.  These values will then be substituted
into the facts and Python statements.
