===================================
KFB Syntax
===================================

This uses the same lexical structure as `KRB files`_, except that the only
keywords are:

- None
- True
- False

The name of the `fact base`_ is simply the filename with the ``.kfb`` suffix
stripped.  This must be a valid Python identifier.

Syntax for KFB File
===================

::

    file ::= [NL] {fact NL}

    fact ::= IDENTIFIER '(' [{data,}] ')'

    data ::= 'None' | 'True' | 'False'
           | NUMBER | IDENTIFIER | STRING
           | '(' [{data,}] ')'


Example
=======

This is taken from the family_relations_ example::

    # family.kfb

    son_of(bruce, thomas, norma)
    son_of(fred_a, thomas, norma)
    son_of(tim, thomas, norma)
    daughter_of(vicki, thomas, norma)
    daughter_of(jill, thomas, norma)

    daughter_of(nanette, arthur2, kathleen)
    son_of(arthur3, arthur2, kathleen)
    daughter_of(sue, arthur2, kathleen)
    son_of(ed, arthur2, kathleen)
    daughter_of(marilyn, arthur2, kathleen)
    son_of(david_b, arthur2, kathleen)
    daughter_of(m_helen, arthur2, kathleen)

    son_of(m_thomas, bruce, marilyn)
    son_of(david_a, bruce, marilyn)
