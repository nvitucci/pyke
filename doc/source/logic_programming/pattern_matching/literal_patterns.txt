================
Literal Patterns
================

You want to ask Pyke a question.  The simplest questions are just asking "Is
statement X true?".  Going back to Pyke's family_relations_ example, your
Python program might want to know whether it's really true that Bruce's
parents are Thomas and Norma?  So it would ask whether the following statement
is true::

    family.son_of(Bruce, Thomas, Norma)

Pyke would search the facts that's it's been told about and answer "thumbs up"
because you've told it before that this statement is true and it has
remembered that.

In this case, all of the statement's arguments are *literal patterns*.  You
might consider literal patterns to be *input* to Pyke.  You're passing Bruce,
Thomas and Norma *into* Pyke.  And Pyke just answers "thumbs up" or "thumbs
down".

Literal patterns look exactly like data.  Thus, your question would look
exactly like you see above.
