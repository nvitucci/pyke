System Requirements
====================

Pyke is 100% Python, so it should run on any platform supported by Python.
So all you'll need is `Python`_ 2.5, 2.6 or 3.1.

Other Required Packages
-----------------------

No other packages are required to develop, run and distribute an application
using Pyke.  But there are package requirements to do the following additional
things:

.. table::
   :class: table-offset

   +--------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | If you want to                 | you also need    | minimum version  |
   +================================+==================+==================+
   | run the web_framework example  | HTMLTemplate_    | 1.5              |
   +--------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | run the unit tests             | `doctest-tools`_ | 1.0a3            |
   +--------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | rebuild the html documentation | rest2web_        | 0.5              |
   +                                +------------------+------------------+
   |                                | docutils_        | 0.4.1            |
   +--------------------------------+------------------+------------------+

If the docutils package is not part of your standard Python installation,
there is probably a package for it in the package index for your Linux
distribution.

All of the other packages can be installed as the administrator using
pip_ or easy_install_.  For example::

    # pip install HTMLTemplate


Installation
============

The source code for the latest release can be found on the `Pyke project
download page`_ as ``pyke-<release>.zip`` (for Python2) and
``pyke3-<release>.zip`` (for Python3).  After unzipping these, go into the
directory and run::

    $ python setup.py build

And then as administrator, run::

    # python setup.py install

The sources include a complete copy of the project directory, including the
documentation, unit tests, and examples.

If you want to clone the source code repository to contribute to the project
development, or to use the latest developer version, read `Modifying Pyke`_.

Run the Examples
================

There are several examples that are contained in the source directory.  Each
example is in it's own subdirectory under the ``examples`` subdirectory, and
each has it's own README.txt file that explains how to run it.

The web_framework example requires the HTMLTemplate_ package, version 1.5 or
later.  This can be installed as administrator with pip or easy_install::

    # pip install HTMLTemplate

See also Examples_.

Viewing the HTML Documentation
==============================

This HTML documentation may be viewed directly from your hard drive.  The HTML
files are in the ``doc/html`` directory.  Start with ``doc/html/index.html``.


Repository Directory Structure
==============================

You'll see the following directories.

* ``doc``

  - the ``html`` directory has all of the HTML documentation ready to browse
    off of your hard drive.  Start with doc/html/index.html.
  - the ``source`` directory has all of the sources that were used to
    generated the HTML documentation.  See `Rebuilding the HTML Documentation`_.
  - the ``examples`` directory just has a copy of the examples used by the
    .txt files in the ``source`` directory so that the doctests will work on
    the ``source`` directory.  You should be able to skip this unless you
    change an example in one of the ``source`` files.
  - ``cheatsheets`` are a collection of text files with notes on various tools
    used by Pyke, and processes used to maintain Pyke.

* ``examples``

  - There are several examples.  Start with *family_relations*.  Look at the
    ``README.txt`` file for each example to see how to run it.  See also,
    Examples_.

* ``experimental``

  - This is a catch-all directory for various ideas that have been tried, but
    that have not been incorporated into Pyke.  You can safely skip over this
    directory...

* ``pyke``

  - This is the top-level Python package directory for the Python sources.
    This needs to be installed into a directory on your ``PYTHONPATH``.
    The sources for the compilers are in the ``krb_compiler`` subdirectory,
    which is expected to be a subpackage of ``pyke``.

* ``Test``

  - This is where the unit test scripts are stored.  These use Python's
    doctest_ package.  Each test file has a .tst suffix.
  - See `Running Unit Tests`_.
